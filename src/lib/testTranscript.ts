  "welcome to whiskey love combo fine\nspirits Pete's my name is luening horst\nluening I'm the master taster of\nwhisky.com and today we have a whiskey\nof one of my favorite distilleries of\nLaur this one is called a blower double\ncask 16 years of age and this one is the\nbottling with 43% there had been one\nwith 40% on the market but this one is\nthe 43% it's priced slightly above 60\neuros dollars pounds wherever you live\nthere are a lot of different matter a\nChanel hour and this one matures in Ex\nbourbon casks and ex-owner also sherry\ncasks and they are mixed after a\nmaturation of 16 years so this is not a\nfinishing but a mixture of two different\ncasts during each 16 years this is\nimportant because the typical finishing\nwhiskies do not show such a big oak\ninfluence because the American white oak\ncasks from the experiment barrels in\nwhich the whiskey matures first and\ntypically do not show these tannins this\nbitterness this intensity and the more\nintense finishing tasks in that cast the\nwhisky resides only six to six months to\nprobably two years and this one is part\nof 16 years in Ex bourbon casks normally\nmatured and 16 years matured in well X\nsherry casks which more intense oak and\nso I expect this whisky to be more\nintense more spicy slightly bitterness\nin the aftertaste yeah we will see the\ndesign of the bottle is the new one so\nthis is what I like what I really like\nthe label is reduced to a very small one\ncontaining a lot of information there's\na small back label for all the legalese\nand the rest\nis a pure bottle quite thick which gives\na dark appearance of the whiskey then\nthere's the cap and a vendor all on top\nso it shows this is really fixed there's\na new one nobody has mixed around a\nmessed around with this whiskey so this\nis 16 years old and the batch is a be 16\nmeans a blower 16 years 119 so I think\nit's the first bottling of 2019 of this\none so how to open this a long-standing\nlegacy our founder James Fleming built\nthe penny bridge after a young boy's\nlife was claimed by the fast-flowing\nSpain he was the type of man who looked\nfor no reward or recognition for his\nkindness so a Balaur\nlies close to the spade in the southern\nshore of the Spain and it's named after\nthe small village of a velar yeah so it\nopens quite well but I didn't want to to\ntear off the complete ban trollese looks\nbetter with that one this is a big park\nas all new apple ours have so pouring is\nquite easy our sherry cask so the\nstandard bottlings of apple are all have\n40% ABV this one has 43 so there's a\nlittle bit more of intensity in this one\nI hope they keep it for the upcoming\nfuture that the older ones have more\nsmooth floral and then nuttiness and\nspiciness from the Cask yeah I miss a\nlittle bit of this sherry fruitiness\nit's not that dominant the spiciness and\nintensity is dominant yeah Cheers hmm\nvery friendly on the tongue\nmouthwatering juicy fruits from the\nsherry spiciness from the cask massive\nimpact on the tongue yeah that's a good\none massive on the tongue long warming\naftertaste and a fine not too strong\nspace spiciness in the back so I expect\nit to have more bitterness or coffee\nespresso notes but no there are Oloroso\nsherry casks which are made of American\nwhite oak probably they use them not the\nEuropean oak casks yeah\nthis is a palapa\nand a a blower which is really what I\nlike but unfortunately it's a little bit\nexpensive with prices over 60 euros for\na 16 year old um but they are selling\ngood amounts of whiskey and the price I\nthink it's it's well in the portfolio of\na Balaur but they have to compete with\nother distilleries which deliver very\ngood whiskey's as well on the other side\nof the Spay and there's Macallan yeah\nand compares to that this one is cheap\nyeah really a good one mm-hmm we will\nsee more and more of the new design of\nApple horror on the market and these\nhuge brown bottles will attract\ncustomers and there will be satisfied by\nthe taste they're receiving afterwards";
