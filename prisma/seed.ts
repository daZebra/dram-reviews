      "hello malty mummified machiavellian marxists \nand that's from i'm not mentioned from schmuck   van fuzel and it's introducing laughter view 879 \nextras in which i'm going to introduce a single   malt with non-age statement just to remind you \nthat i do buy them i don't review them because   it's it's like there's missing information you you \njust i've got to ask yourself what am i actually   paying for here because i'm not paying for the \nage of them all because there's no age statement   but some of them are pretty damn good laphroaig \nlower society laphroaig get no age statements   a good whiskey but you feel as if that \ndenial of information lets the producers   add quite a few extra pounds on top of what \nthey're asking because they're basically   you're relying on their integrity and i'm \nnot comfortable with that i'm far happier   to have that you see with the \ndisclosure of an age statement   you're getting respect from \ndistillers but i do understand   why they bring out the non-age statement because \nthe majority of blends are known each statement but this one is glen scotia victoriana it's got a lot going for it although it doesn't have an age statement   but i tell you what i will tell you \nabout it is that um it's 51.5 percent and until filtered and that's basically \nit it says it states it's a classic   campbelltown malt and finished in \nthe finest deep charred oak casks   in fact it says twice in the \nfront label it's unchill filtered   but they don't give us an edge statement so i'm \ngoing to take and i i guess with my experience   at what age it is and i'm going to \nbriefly talk about how you separate   younger whiskeys from older whiskeys \nwhen the producers refuse to tell you first of all gently roll the liquor \naround the inside of the glass   hold it up to the light and examine the coat \nline the coat line is where the wet bit meets   the dry bit and you'll see beads appear like a \nstring of pearls and a necklace in this instance they're sort of i would call them medium-sized \nthey're hanging for about four to five seconds   and then they're dropping \non what's called medium legs   and the legs are the little lines of the beaded \nliquor sliding down the inside of the glass now   if you get tiny little pearls that drop \nvery rapidly that is a sign of young whiskey   that hasn't spent much time in a cask if it hangs \nabout as a thick line with fatter beads which fall   more slowly and broader legs that is a sign of \nan older whiskey that's been in a cask for longer   so that's one of your first clues knows it how much cask influence can you smell off \nthe liquor if it is sharp and pungent and spirity   that is a sign that is a younger whiskey but \nit's a bit more complex than that because it's   a sign that's a young there's a younger whiskey \nthat spent a short time in a cask or a younger   whiskey which is spent a far longer time in a less \neffective cask a fatigued cask a non-maturing cask   because a cask can age a whiskey but it doesn't \nnecessarily mature because if the cask is fatigued   it's been filled three maybe four times \nbefore the energy has gone out the cask   and the only way you could spot that is when \nyou're looking and smelling at the whiskey   and noticing as much what's \nnot there that's what is there   sometimes it's very difficult to figure \nit out but it comes with experience   i'm getting that complexity these leather \nnotes and the slight tobacco notes of an older   sherry cask probably an older sherry but but \ni'm also getting the younger nose in here   which is giving a richer delivery of the signature \nand the identity of glenn scotia single malt which   is one of the finest in scotland by the way always \nwas a favorite historically with the blenders so you're getting the fresh fruit notes \nof a younger whiskey but you're getting   the cask influence coming in at an early \nstage see they're both together immediately   that's another clue that what they've done is \nthey've taken younger whiskey and then they've   put in one or two casks into their batch of \nolder whiskey just to lift it up beyond its years one reason they would do that is \nwhen they're searching through the   warehouse and they find a fight they find \na fine old sherry cask looking at the back   that hasn't been disturbed for many years because \nbigger casks are harder to move in a warehouse   they require more people to move it they require \nforklift truck if the truck can get access you   see with small casks one or two people can \nhandle them and move them and roll them   and stack them and tip them up put them in end \nrelatively easily but not with a big 600 liter   but you can't do that and generally that's \nwhere the sherries that's the sherry style   it's the sherry casks are the biggy big ones so \nit's lingering at the back of the warehouse and   someone points out to the management by the way \nsee that cast we've just checked it and it's at   35 percent volume we've had big evaporator of \nevaporation losses and the managers go damn   we were hoping to bottle that as some fancy \n25 or 30 year old single malt but it's below   the legal minimum so do we have another cast \nthat we can sort of is strong enough in volume   to take it from 35 back over 40 percent and \neven once we've done that is it still going   to be flavoursome and substantial and are people \ngoing to be prepared to pay a lot of money for   it and frankly sometimes that's not the case so \ni'm giving you a bit of insider knowledge here   just to give you perspective so they \ntake this fine old cask and they say   you know it's got age but it's not got a \nlot else i'll tell you what if we put that   into younger whiskey say some 15 year old whiskey \nit's going to make it smell and taste a lot older and we can charge a bit more for it but tell you \nwhat we won't charge too much we won't take the   piss out of them and i think that that's what \nthey've done here with victoriana it's one of   the best of the standard range and i tell you \nwhat malt makes you're getting a good bang for   your buck in the british isles if you're to \nbuy it because one of the advantages of not   having an age statement is they can't \nsell the whiskey in the age statement   do you see where i'm coming from you've got to \ntake it and trust it's like johnny walker blue   label well that's the best isn't it because it's \nyou know it doesn't have an age statement so it's   the most expensive and therefore it must have \nthe oldest the finest the rarest whiskies in it maybe not to be honest maybe it's \njust the grooming of the consumer   that's been taking place as all brig brands do \nit's not been a good year for them by the way   for the big blended brands with pubs shut bars \nshut hotels shut weddings not taking place   funerals not taking place above the most simple \nand practical form with no big parties afterwards   with airports closed down this has had a huge \nimpact on the sale of blended whiskey but   for those of us who buy online and thank goodness \nfor online it didn't didn't arrive a moment too   soon to be honest we've been able to go out \nand discover and source far more variety of   single malts than we've previously had access to \nand when we go out there to find out about them   when we go to see them we're going to \nspot them we need to know about them   we need to know the back story and therefore i am \ngiving you an opinion backstory on this particular   single malt which happens to be a very \ncommendable high rating single malt in my opinion   and i recommend it and i recommend everything that \nglenn scotia are doing at the moment particularly   if they stick to chill-filled non-chill filtering \nnon-chill filtering natural color and bottling at   higher strength and perhaps that is one \nreason why their 25 year old single malt   recently won the international wines and spirits \ncompetition best single malt in the world   well done glenn scotia i'm gonna toast \nto you you've earned it i tell you what it wasn't that long ago that visiting glen scotia was virtually impossible \nyou'd have to phone ahead there was very few   staff there my goodness they were doing the \nbest they could with the resources they had but the place needed major investment particularly \nin casks and the stills needed a good clean and it was off the radar and people didn't \nbother about glen scotia because they were too   busy heading to spring bank but now spring \nbank is getting harder and harder to buy   it's getting harder and harder to find now \nwe've got to spread our wings we've got to   adapt with the morphing environment out \nthere and glen scotia is definitely a worthy   competitor to spring bank both in the same \nlocation same style of whiskey essentially and   i've been hearing things about peter glenn scotia \nvery interesting things indeed time will tell but there's a wonderful rich fruit \nfruitcakes smokiness going on in here it's such a fantastic old-school character drum   this is the sort of bottle that i would buy \nanother three of and put them in the stash   in case the price just goes up and up and \nup and up because tell you what malt makes   to be forewarned is to be forearmed \nand to be forearmed is to be prepared   but it's a delicious whiskey absolutely rafi \nrecommended and i would conclude by saying that when you have these odd whiskies it can work really well because what \ni'm tasting here is some younger fresher whiskey   and some older smokier leathery tobacco whiskey \nand they've been beautifully blended together   i can assure you of that and the result is \njust it's fantastic actually it really is a slight slightly reserved in the the development \nyou get this lush barley sugar arrival from the   younger fresher single malt and then you get this \nsmoky resonance sherry in the shorter development   because the intensity of the younger malt is kind \nof driving through and pushing on pushing away the   older whiskey into the the latter part of the \ndevelopment and then both occupy the finish and   the finish is just crispy tannic fresh delicious \nslightly savory slightly umami deliciously so it's really such a shame that the rules do \nnot allow a distiller to disclose on the label   the proportion and age of \nthe single malt constructions   it has been tried and it's been knocked back \nand even the irish distillers some irish   independent bottles been getting into trouble \nabout it which i think is fundamentally wrong   and it's an opportunity for a world whiskey \ndistiller out with the british isles to jump   on it make it a feature run with it and take full \nadvantage of it i'm ralphie this is my extras done   and dusted and a very tasty extras it was too \nany conclusion i would conclude by saying that i understand why non-age statements are \nout there because it provides flexibility   but unfortunately from my perspective it \ngives all the flexibility to the producers   when they withhold that information and we have \nto take them and trust as regards their pricing   because you could also have a non-age statement \nwhiskey in which younger whiskey's just put into   say for example a distillery bottle some 40 \nyear old single malt now what you're going   to do with a cask an empty cask you're going \nto roll out to the backyard and put it in fire   turn it into land pill filler or sell it to the \nlocal joiner to be turned into planting tubs i   don't think so i really don't think so because \nyou've got to smell that cask a 40 year old   single mom it's going to be magnificent so in \nfact you're using a really old cask that's been   emptied and its contents bottled and you're \nputting younger whiskey in it for a cask finish but it's on its own single malt in-house cask \nfinish right don't hear so much about them do you   but they do exist happens all the time distillers \nproducers at warehouses they don't just discard   casks unless they need to so if you've got a 40 \nyear old cask that's been gone the goal for 40   years and it's just smells magnificent and you \nget it straight back from the mottling plant   where it's been off to for bottling so you get \nthat cask empty cask back as fresh as a daisy plugged up totally intact right get \nsome younger whiskey fill up that cask the effect is magnificent the fact is effect is \nmarvelous but they can't use the younger you they   could use the un under the younger age statement \nbut then people would buy it and say see this   this 10 year old whiskey that went into a 40 year \nold cask for one year so it's 11 year old whiskey   oh my goodness this is absolutely so fantastic i'm \ngoing to buy half a dozen bottles but then they go   back to re-buy the that particular brand again a \nyear later and that particular batch is all gone   they're saying oh i'm a bit disappointed it's now \nsmelling and tasting like the actual age on the   label see this is another reason fairness to the \ndistillers why sometimes they bring out non-age   statement whiskies but i'll leave it to that \nnow sharing the knowledge sharing the journey   thanks for being more mates i'm ralphie \nfrom the bothy speak to you soon bye",

      "we tend to lament over our favorite expressions \nwhen they've run their course and are replaced   by a new edition we always think the original is \nthe best and we have nostalgia for it right and   how can this new version be better than the \noriginal and today's bottle glenn scotia   victoriana is a prime example batch one has \nbeen discontinued but thanks to my whiskey   buddies phil and deepa from whiskey mystery \ni have a sample of batch 2 the latest version   of victoriana and today i'm gonna do a \nblind test on batch one versus batch two   let's talk about whiskey from the whiskiest place \nin the world located in the kintar peninsula in   campbelltown once known as the whiskey capital of \nthe world because at one time it had more than 30   distilleries today there are only three which is \nthe minimum required to have a region named after   it by the swa scotch whiskey association but \nwhat they lack in quantity they make up for in   quality and those three distilleries are \nglenn scotia that's we'll talk about today   other two would be spring bank which also has \nbrands of long grow and hazel burn and then   glengile which bottles their expressions under \nthe name of kilcaren these distilleries produce   exceptional sold after and lovely expressions glen \nscotia has to be the gloria gaynor disco queen of   campbelltown declaring i will survive \nsince 1832 this distillery has gone   up and down and back and forth with various \nowners in repair disrepair it's amazing that   it has gone through all the iterations to come \nout to produce the whiskey that it does today   and in 1999 they got a good shot in the arm and a \nlot more investment and it's brought glen scotia   into this glorious state that it is right now and \nyet it still is able with all that new investment   been able to retain the mash tun the steelhouse \nand the dunnage warehouse most of glen scotia's   expressions are non-peated they will do a run \nof peated whiskey for about six weeks each year   they produce on average about eight hundred \nthousand leaders each year which is online   with their neighbors spring bank and glen gile \nvictoriana was introduced as an expression in   2015. it's a non-age statement and it \nfeatures maturation in highly deeply   recharged barrels as a throwback to the \nway whiskey was made in the victorian age   this version of victoriana is the original batch \none at 51.5 abv the newest edition batch 2 comes   in at 54.2 so be interesting to see the difference \nin the abv you can read my original review on   batch one on my blog scotchonthebayou.com have you \nhad either batches one or two of victoriana let me   know in the comments below what you thought about \nthem or if you've had any glenn scotia at all and   take a moment to hit that like button subscribe \nand hit notifications so you'll be notified when   new content comes out on this channel so though \nthey're two different batches these items are the   same in that they're both non-chill filtered \nno color added and there's no age statement   again nas and they're about 80 to 100 a bottle \ni'll cut to the chase i absolutely adore batch one   i love it so much so that i have ensured that i \nhave a couple of backup bottles since it is hard   to find nowadays and because of that i have \na pretty good idea about the way it tastes   so in fairness to batch two i had my husband \npour me blind samples so we're gonna give these   we've got a yellow and a red and we're gonna see \nwhich is which see if i can tell the difference   which i prefer odds are i'm probably gonna like \nboth of them let's see so looking at the color   there's definitely a difference the \nyellow sample is more yellow and   the red sample is got more of an \norange ambery tinge to it both are   quite oily and viscous looking hanging on \nthe glass really well let's go for the nose the yellow sample is very \nfragrant with caramels and malty yeah malt's definitely there   but some sweetness going on more like \na candy pecan kind of thing going interesting the red it's much lighter much lighter on the nose and uh not as bright um more like stewed \nfruit or not as much this had more like burnt   sugar to it and this is much more mellow \nsmelly here's the taste for sample yellow wonderful taste it feels pretty hot hotter than i remember the other but i \npurposely haven't had this in probably a month   because i wanted this to be as fair as it could be   more of the caramel kind of burnt sugar on \nyellow there's a little honey and vanilla there   interesting it's very tasty okay let's do a \ntaste on red it's a much more mellow flavor but it's got more heat on spice on the end this is \nvery interesting you do get the char out of yellow more on the finish dry still spicy \nmore of a like a cinnamon ginger thing   but with the underlying sweetness is \nstill there so yellow is pretty hot it is bright it's clean pretty crisp it's uh definitely got \na lot of warmth going on i mean even   my lips are tingling a little bit yeah it's \ndefinitely much more mellow than you the yellow   yeah i'm probably gonna have to take \na quick break to reset everything   because 250 plus abvs are kind of wreaking havoc \non the o palette here hang on so back to the red   i'm definitely getting more of this dude fruit \nkind of fig prunish kind of thing going on   and it's abv wise i'm i'm gonna guess this is \nbatch one because it's much more approachable   the finish is hanging on kind of get bits of \nalmost like a chocolate kind of thing and and   again you've got a little bit of praline candy \npecan kind of taste it's a little dry you get some   char on this but i actually got more char in the \nother one on the yellow finish is much sweeter on   the red than the yellow so let's add some water \nto this because this abv is a bit much um so this   is red so i'm gonna add a couple drops in there to \nthat one okay and let's add some water into yellow   oh a lot more malt on the yellow with the water \nit's still pretty potent yellow is much brighter   crisper more it's almost more \nbourbon forward for me than red red yeah with the water you still get a good bit of \nsweetness from the stewed fruits yellow is not   as sweet as the red yellow has more charred than \nthe red yellow i believe is definitely higher abd   hoof yeah my palette's about shot right \nnow guys here's where we're gonna go   i'm gonna say yellow is the batch too and i'm \ngonna say red is batch one so let's do a reveal   and i'm not gonna look at them i'm gonna there's \nno way this is gonna show up on here but mark   put the numbers on here so i'm gonna go yellow \nis batch two and red is the original batch one   interesting they are pretty different from \nmy palette from batch one to batch two   or batch one to batch two when you come to \nthe idea of one being better than the other   that doesn't really hold a lot of water in \nthe sense that everyone's palate is different   however if you have the first batch \nor the first iteration of something   you have in your mind what it should be the second \ntime it comes around and when it's different i   think that's the point where people think well no \nit's not as good as the original is just different   than the original and you may prefer it there may \nbe times you prefer the second iteration than the   first between the two i really like both of them i \nthink yellow could probably the second batch could   really hold some more water and pull it back down \na little bit the abv on batch 2 is significantly   different and more than batch one so much so that \ni could pretty much tell that right off the bat flavor profile is also a little different \nwhere this yellow batch 2 was more bourbon   forward with some more pronounced char where \nbatch one had a slight bit of char but had   more pronounced sweetness like the figs and the \nstewed fruit to it and even some chocolate notes   both of them are pretty damn tasty so tell me in \nthe comments if you've had either one of these   expressions batch one batch two of victoriana \nand if you've had any of glen scotia at all my   whiskey buddy mark jg is a big fan of the glen \nscotia 15 and that is a very good dram if you   haven't tried any Glen Scotia give it a shot \ni've not found a bad one i gotta tell you that   of these two of the batch two in the batch \none my palette preference is the batch one   i like that it's more approachable with the abv i \nlike the fact that it has more of the steed fruits   but i'm not going to turn down batch 2 no way \nif you've enjoyed this video please give it a   thumbs up hit subscribe and the notifications \nso you are informed when i put out new videos   on bottles or life in louisiana \nand until next time Slainte y'all",
