      "full_text": "what's up guys welcome to g whiskey my name is jeff this is a channel where i offer my thoughts and opinions on a specific whisky and if you stick around to the end i'll be giving it a score as well that sounds interesting hit subscribe down below and with that out of the way why don't we jump into our review today we're looking at a classic we've got the lagavulin 16. stick around [Music] i don't know why it took me so long to get around to a review of this one this one is like this should be in your first five videos if you're trying to break into the whiskey youtuber scene um it's a legend it's a classic all of you know it most of you probably love it like of all in 16. this bad boy's been around since 1988 it's part of diageo's classic malts range and this bottle is probably one of the most famous ambassadors for isle of whiskey that we have out there uh which is kind of interesting because it's different this is very different from a lot of the other isle of big boys stuff like your art bags or your laphroaigs and that's because this stuff is softer it's gentler it's calmer we do get peat and smoke in here but it's more rounded it's more refined than what we'll get with most of the other isla offerings for better or for worse um and you know of course a lot of people do turn to isle of whiskey's because they want that more rugged punch your character but this one is definitely one of your more pretty isla offerings and it's worth noting that that applies to our 16 specifically the eight-year-old the 12 year old cast strength those are about as rough and tumble as any other isla out there uh but our 16 here has built its reputation on being very accessible it's great for people who are maybe beginners or just getting started with the isle of flavor profiles it's a great stepping stone into that world but it's also like layered and complex enough that a lot of seasoned whiskey drinkers can get behind it too and you know i've always liked it precisely because it is a more refined and calmer option from isla traditionally there haven't been two too many of those there's definitely like a gentlemanly appeal to this it's not as loud or as intense or as rugged or as scrappy as art bags or laphroaig's part of that is due to the lower abv which it does get criticized for i mean rightly so and it also gets criticized for being not quite as good as it used to be back in the day but to be fair i mean that's the kind of thing that people say about pretty much every whiskey out there sometimes it's true sometimes it isn't us whiskey drinkers can be a nostalgic bunch for sure so let's see if this is as good as the lager from the good old days let's see if this dinosaur is still competitive in today's market let's jump into our review see what our whisky is all about and in the meantime if you could kindly leave a like down below that'd be greatly appreciated well we do have a diageo product here so we can expect to be underwhelmed our abv comes in at 43 it is going to be chill filtered it is a colored whiskey um you know disappointing yes absolutely surprising no tinted bottle here so we can't make out the color of our whiskey um i love like a villain bottles i think they look fantastic i like that they haven't really updated or changed the look in a really long time i do feel like the look of the bottle kind of suits the whiskey that we've got inside it's got a restrained old-school kind of gentlemanly elegance to it a wonderful bottle so i'm going to give this maybe four and a half out of five obviously they're not going to brag about being colored or chill filtered why would they diago in general though is pretty famous for sharing next to nothing when it comes to stuff like production information or just useful information in general it's annoying i suppose we should expect at this point um yeah it's still a great bottle though i did not add water let's try our nose uh sweet soft refined we have pete and sherry in equal measure here both very gentle seamlessly integrated we have some minerals some rooibos tea um some oysters a little bit of grenadine we have sea air we have himalayan rock salt we have like ribs slathered in like a sweet barbecue sauce maybe some some sliced oranges in there classic lagging nose let's try the palette very easy arrival um pete comes on first uh bonfire bonfire logs bonfire smoke embers um black pepper grilled meat definitely some leather in here there's also some candied fruit like candied apple candied strawberries some maraschino cherries and now we're finished all right um gets fruitier and drier here more maraschino cherries um i'm picturing one of those fancy dark chocolate bars with like bits of chili in it i also have bits of fruit bits of almonds too there's also smoke earth leather and autumn leaves our finish is medium in length well this one is still a classic um there's not a lot about this whiskey that i don't like um it's got all the elements that made it a classic it's got that grown up gentlemanly character uh i've previously referred to this whiskey as the ultimate fireside whiskey i still think that's true i imagine myself sitting on an antique leather armchair in my study next to the fireplace um i don't have a study or a fireplace and anyway i'm sipping on this i'm reading a good book and i'm listening to the fire crackle in the background and i have a mustache now this is not a whiskey that you're going to feed to someone if you want to like blow them away with intensity um i mean you know i guess for the uninitiated who are just getting into pete this one is going to have like big peat and it's going to feel punchy and very smoky but i think if you've had enough pete this one will be relatively tame um there's definitely a lot of much more aggressively peated whiskies out there and i like it for that i like the vibe that this whiskey gives me it's got that special quality it takes me somewhere uh that being said it's not perfect there are some areas that we can definitely improve upon here and that's not really lag of owen's fault that's more diageo's fault i think the intrinsic quality of our whiskey here is fantastic it's absolutely brimming with flavor honestly more flavor than it has any right having it just 43 uh that being said at 43 it is a little light in the body it definitely should be 46. um also i think the the mutterings from like the whiskey curmudgeons out there might actually be right on this one i also kind of think yeah this one was better back in the day you know memory can be a little bit dicey at times so i'm not totally convinced this used to be a lot better than it is now um the flavors the profile it's all pretty much the same but i do seem to remember a little bit more maybe depth or nuance to the older versions so yeah i think the lag of one 16s of yesteryear had a little bit more complexity and i would need a side by side to confirm that but yeah i do feel like this one is a little bit simpler that being said it's still a damn fine pour it's still a whiskey i'm always happy to come back to so i'm gonna give this one a score of 86. older ones probably would have been 88. so we've got a charming approachable unique fruity profile here we have stuff like bonfire notes embers cherries oranges i don't think i've ever not enjoyed drinking like a villain 16. uh nostalgia might be a factor there but no i mean it's good it's a good whiskey um also what other peated isla distillery is giving us affordable age-stated whiskies these days i guess there's laphroaig with the 16. definitely some bulmores fine there's a few but there should be more um regardless this is an excellent whiskey again it's got very broad appeal it's one that beginners can get behind as well as seasoned old timers like myself so it's definitely one to try if you haven't i think most experienced single malt whiskey drinkers will have tried this one before but if you're new if you're just getting into whiskey if you want to dip your tone into those temperamental isle of waters definitely check this one out it's a classic it's a rite of passage our value here is okay i'm not going to say it's great it has climbed in price quite a bit over the last few years in my market it's not super expensive for a 16 year old but it's not particularly cheap either there was a time that this was among the cheaper 16 year olds you could buy and that's definitely no longer the case still this is a bottle i'm gonna suggest you pick up maybe split one um listen our specs are weak here the prices have been climbing over the last few years this is not a bottle that's going to be worth it forever for the time being while the price is still somewhat reasonable it's worth trying you have to experience this one at least once all right that's gonna be it for me today guys thank you very much for watching if you want to help support the channel please consider becoming a patron otherwise like comment and subscribe always appreciated i do want to hear from you have you tried our lag of all in 16 here what were your thoughts

like\nribs slathered in like a sweet barbecue\nsauce\nmaybe some some sliced oranges in there\nclassic lagging nose\nlet's try the palette\nvery easy arrival um pete comes on first\nuh bonfire bonfire logs\nbonfire smoke\nembers\num black pepper\ngrilled meat\ndefinitely some leather in here\nthere's also some candied fruit like\ncandied apple candied strawberries some\nmaraschino cherries\nand now we're finished\nall right\num gets\nfruitier and drier here\nmore maraschino cherries\num\ni'm picturing one of those fancy dark\nchocolate bars with like bits of chili\nin it\ni also have bits of fruit bits of\nalmonds too\nthere's also smoke earth leather and\nautumn leaves our finish is\nmedium in length\nwell this one is still a classic um\nthere's not a lot about this whiskey\nthat i don't like um it's got all the\nelements that made it a classic it's got\nthat grown up gentlemanly character uh\ni've previously referred to this whiskey\nas the ultimate fireside whiskey i still\nthink that's true\ni imagine myself sitting on an antique\nleather armchair in my study next to the\nfireplace um i don't have a study or a\nfireplace\nand anyway i'm sipping on this i'm\nreading a good book and i'm listening to\nthe fire crackle in the background\nand i have a mustache\nnow this is not a whiskey that you're\ngoing to feed to someone if you want to\nlike blow them away with intensity um i\nmean\nyou know i guess for the uninitiated who\nare just getting into pete this one is\ngoing to have like big peat and it's\ngoing to feel punchy and very smoky but\ni think if you've had enough pete this\none will be relatively tame um there's\ndefinitely a lot of much more\naggressively peated whiskies out there\nand i like it for that i like the vibe\nthat this whiskey gives me it's got that\nspecial quality it takes me somewhere uh\nthat being said it's not perfect there\nare some areas that we can definitely\nimprove upon here and that's not really\nlag of owen's fault that's more diageo's\nfault\ni think the intrinsic quality of our\nwhiskey here is fantastic it's\nabsolutely brimming with flavor honestly\nmore flavor than it has any right having\nit just 43\nuh that being said at 43 it is a little\nlight in the body it definitely should\nbe 46.\num\nalso i think the the mutterings from\nlike the whiskey curmudgeons out there\nmight actually be right on this one i\nalso kind of think yeah this one was\nbetter back in the day\nyou know memory can be a little bit\ndicey at times so i'm not totally\nconvinced this used to be a lot better\nthan it is now um the flavors the\nprofile it's all pretty much the same\nbut i do seem to remember a little bit\nmore maybe depth or nuance to the older\nversions\nso yeah i think the lag of one 16s of\nyesteryear\nhad a little bit more complexity\nand i would need a side by side to\nconfirm that but yeah i do feel like\nthis one is a little bit simpler that\nbeing said it's still a damn fine pour\nit's still a whiskey i'm always happy to\ncome back to so i'm gonna give this one\na score of\n86. older ones probably would have been\n88.\nso we've got a charming approachable\nunique fruity profile here we have stuff\nlike bonfire notes embers cherries\noranges\ni don't think i've ever not enjoyed\ndrinking like a villain 16. uh nostalgia\nmight be a factor there but no i mean\nit's good it's a good whiskey um also\nwhat other peated isla distillery is\ngiving us affordable age-stated whiskies\nthese days i guess there's laphroaig\nwith the 16.\ndefinitely some bulmores\nfine there's a few but there should be\nmore um regardless this is an excellent\nwhiskey again it's got very broad appeal\nit's one that beginners can get behind\nas well as seasoned old timers like\nmyself\nso it's definitely one to try if you\nhaven't i think most experienced single\nmalt whiskey drinkers will have tried\nthis one before but if you're new if\nyou're just getting into whiskey if you\nwant to dip your tone into those\ntemperamental isle of waters definitely\ncheck this one out it's a classic it's a\nrite of passage\nour value here is okay i'm not going to\nsay it's great it has climbed in price\nquite a bit over the last few years in\nmy market\nit's not super expensive for a 16 year\nold but it's not particularly cheap\neither there was a time that this was\namong the cheaper 16 year olds you could\nbuy and that's definitely no longer the\ncase\nstill this is a bottle i'm gonna suggest\nyou pick up maybe split one um listen\nour specs are weak here the prices have\nbeen climbing over the last few years\nthis is not a bottle that's going to be\nworth it forever for the time being\nwhile the price is still somewhat\nreasonable\nit's worth trying you have to experience\nthis one at least once\nall right that's gonna be it for me\ntoday guys thank you very much for\nwatching if you want to help support the\nchannel please consider becoming a\npatron otherwise like comment and\nsubscribe always appreciated i do want\nto hear from you have you tried our lag\nof all in 16 here what were your\nthoughts finally down below in the\ncomments let me know you want to see me\nreview next i'll keep it in mind for my\nupcoming videos\nbye guys\nyou",

scappa skiren skiren is an old Nordic word means bright Skies glittering and describes the well the brightness of the Nordic summer scaa is a Distillery which was closed for times say they produced very little whiskey over the years and um they had been a very famous scaa 14 years old and this was sold really really well um then The Distillery changed prop the eltoc which uh held the scapa distillery in former times were bought by Dio and pero car and they divided this conglomerate U into pieces and uh the scappa went to peror car and uh then they decided Well we will have another one and another bottling and uh we will restart produ production we will renovate The Distillery and when I visited scaa in 2004 they were just in the process of renovating uh The Distillery and uh well freshing everything up and they invested well I think a few million and uh the 16-year-old uh I have a video of that uh came into the market and well it was expensive it was really really expensive well they increased the avv a little bit uh but sales uh well collapsed is is the right word and today the scappa 16-year-old is the only original bottling from The Distillery as far as I know and uh well sales are not that well so they brought out in the fall of 2015 this Capa skiren and unfortunately no age statement on it uh but first fill American White Oak casks and if you have a look at the bottle then they are telling uh this expression is exclusively matured in first fil American Oak for a smooth creamy sweetness with a hint of tropical fruit Citrus and Coastal Heather um batch sk1 so this uh skiren is the first batch of skiren and there will be consecutive batches um 100% first fill 40% ABV uh yeah and why do they use the old Nordic word well the O inel Islands uh belonged to to the well the Nordic uh I think they were the the kings of the uh the region which uh today is called Norway yeah and uh they try to well to base on their Heritage to say well we are Nordic we are in uh a mod from the okay um unfortunately this one is colored with sugar caramel it's really fruity in the nose already here at the cork I think there is something written on the back within reach of the Arctic Circle scappa part of the AG aisle archipelago is ruled by the elements perched on the Tranquil shores of scappa flow The scaa Distillery is perfectly placed to look out upon the everchanging Seas and skies to survive here Islanders have learned to harness Nature's contrast and make the most of the gentler month when the Horizon is bright and gleaming skan it is these Light summer nights when our home is bathed in Endless Twilight that have inspired the creation of the smooth HED single M crafted the aradian way our team of Artisans Pride themselves on using traditional methods and skills honed over several Generations the result is deliciously smooth flowing with mellow fruits and Heather honey and bringing to mind scapa flow's natural Sanctuary from the Restless elements Beyond yeah really fruity there Tangerine in it so a little Citrus with a a sweet nose well balanced flowing in the back probably some honey but not too intense and the Heather well some herbs might be Heather and then caramel and vanilla coming up showing through from the first fil American Oak but they come quite late so the first impact in the nose are these fruity Aromas The Taste is quite smooth there's no impact of alcohol just 40% ABV and then some spiciness arises yeah from the OAS and well yeah some coffe espresso coming through faint bitterness in the aftertaste which is a little bit drier so The Distillery was refurbished in 2004 and I think they started to produce in 2005 and uh so today there might be whiskey available close to 10 years of age um I do not taste these young metallic Mouse covering Aromas of a young whiskey no this one is already mature that you can't feel uh the original well youness of this whiskey so it's old enough uh but the the tastees the additional Aromas from the casks are not too intense there is this okess showing through already so I would suggest that this whiskey [Music] is 7 8 n close to 10 years old probably they have mixed the younger car skin Oh but this one is no simple nass whiskey no age statement uh this is a better one and I'm afraid this one is extremely expensive um the 14-year-old from the past was affordable sold in huge numbers the 16-year-old was then well quite expensive and people did not like to move to it um then this one was placed in the market for close to 60 Euros dollars pounds whatever and the 16 year old they moved it up to well I think over 100 so the amounts of Whiskey aailable from the time before the renovation might be very very small so that they they can afford to rise those prices extremely the the sales of the 16-year-old will go down extremely they know that and therefore I think uh the whiskey from the time before 2004 is gone now there's some caramel and vanilla coming up quite late but now it's more intense and the Tangerine satus node is still present well balanced and the aftertaste is already gone thank you for watching there's more to come stay tuned and feel free to share this video with your friends and add your comments in our forum and in our whiskey database thank you [Music]",
