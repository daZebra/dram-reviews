  "full_text": "really [Music] fruity welcome to whiskey.com where F Spirits meet my name is loing horse Ling I'm the master tast of whiskey.com and today we have a new scappa here on my cast the scappa skiren skiren is an old Nordic word means bright Skies glittering and describes the well the brightness of the Nordic summer scaa is a Distillery which was closed for times say they produced very little whiskey over the years and um they had been a very famous scaa 14 years old and this was sold really really well um then The Distillery changed prop the eltoc which uh held the scapa distillery in former times were bought by Dio and pero car and they divided this conglomerate U into pieces and uh the scappa went to peror car and uh then they decided Well we will have another one and another bottling and uh we will restart produ production we will renovate The Distillery and when I visited scaa in 2004 they were just in the process of renovating uh The Distillery and uh well freshing everything up and they invested well I think a few million and uh the 16-year-old uh I have a video of that uh came into the market and well it was expensive it was really really expensive well they increased the avv a little bit uh but sales uh well collapsed is is the right word and today the scappa 16-year-old is the only original bottling from The Distillery as far as I know and uh well sales are not that well so they brought out in the fall of 2015 this Capa skiren and unfortunately no age statement on it uh but first fill American White Oak casks and if you have a look at the bottle then they are telling uh this expression is exclusively matured in first fil American Oak for a smooth creamy sweetness with a hint of tropical fruit Citrus and Coastal Heather um batch sk1 so this uh skiren is the first batch of skiren and there will be consecutive batches um 100% first fill 40% ABV uh yeah and why do they use the old Nordic word well the O inel Islands uh belonged to to the well the Nordic uh I think they were the the kings of the uh the region which uh today is called Norway yeah and uh they try to well to base on their Heritage to say well we are Nordic we are in uh a mod from the okay um unfortunately this one is colored with sugar caramel it's really fruity in the nose already here at the cork I think there is something written on the back within reach of the Arctic Circle scappa part of the AG aisle archipelago is ruled by the elements perched on the Tranquil shores of scappa flow The scaa Distillery is perfectly placed to look out upon the everchanging Seas and skies to survive here Islanders have learned to harness Nature's contrast and make the most of the gentler month when the Horizon is bright and gleaming skan it is these Light summer nights when our home is bathed in Endless Twilight that have inspired the creation of the smooth HED single M crafted the aradian way our team of Artisans Pride themselves on using traditional methods and skills honed over several Generations the result is deliciously smooth flowing with mellow fruits and Heather honey and bringing to mind scapa flow's natural Sanctuary from the Restless elements Beyond yeah really fruity there Tangerine in it so a little Citrus with a a sweet nose well balanced flowing in the back probably some honey but not too intense and the Heather well some herbs might be Heather and then caramel and vanilla coming up showing through from the first fil American Oak but they come quite late so the first impact in the nose are these fruity Aromas The Taste is quite smooth there's no impact of alcohol just 40% ABV and then some spiciness arises yeah from the OAS and well yeah some coffe espresso coming through faint bitterness in the aftertaste which is a little bit drier so The Distillery was refurbished in 2004 and I think they started to produce in 2005 and uh so today there might be whiskey available close to 10 years of age um I do not taste these young metallic Mouse covering Aromas of a young whiskey no this one is already mature that you can't feel uh the original well youness of this whiskey so it's old enough uh but the the tastees the additional Aromas from the casks are not too intense there is this okess showing through already so I would suggest that this whiskey [Music] is 7 8 n close to 10 years old probably they have mixed the younger car skin Oh but this one is no simple nass whiskey no age statement uh this is a better one and I'm afraid this one is extremely expensive um the 14-year-old from the past was affordable sold in huge numbers the 16-year-old was then well quite expensive and people did not like to move to it um then this one was placed in the market for close to 60 Euros dollars pounds whatever and the 16 year old they moved it up to well I think over 100 so the amounts of Whiskey aailable from the time before the renovation might be very very small so that they they can afford to rise those prices extremely the the sales of the 16-year-old will go down extremely they know that and therefore I think uh the whiskey from the time before 2004 is gone now there's some caramel and vanilla coming up quite late but now it's more intense and the Tangerine satus node is still present well balanced and the aftertaste is already gone thank you for watching there's more to come stay tuned and feel free to share this video with your friends and add your comments in our forum and in our whiskey database thank you [Music]",
