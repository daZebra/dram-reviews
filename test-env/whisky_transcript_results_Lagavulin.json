and the rocks and in cocktails here we go also like And subscribe maybe bye [Music] hello how are you so the flavor Cloud the two of you will compete to name the most frequently tasted flavors in lagable in 16. that's right can I pour some yeah sure no I mean for me uh well yes but also your opponent as well please flip a Glenn coin to see who gets to submit their flavors first oh take an eye out oh I get to go first why do you look like a communist dictator I do a Russian Czar as we approach this Mighty Battle of the wits how are you guys feeling hi ah we don't care okay that's fair um Daniel please your glass and submit your flavors the flavor cloud is a visual representation of the flavor's whiskey drinkers are collectively finding in lagavulin 16. the contestants are locking in their answers now what are your flavors I'm gonna start with Pete hmm veto all right I replace it with smoke interesting oh shoot interesting malt vanilla Brian honey fruity oh someone's Mike is doing something me there we go that actually did something no all right then leave it to me to poke a butt uh pepper salt okay salt or salt that probably eliminates the salt water as an option for me right yes okay grass and wax your last flavor this is how confident I am boobin is that the coffee yeah yeah okay delicious bourbon oh I'm gonna replace boob and iodine veto [Laughter] oh Mike I haven't moved is that really work every time I wonder what it is leather okay okay the results of the flavor clown are in flavors clouds flameless clouds give me a drum roll please Rex your score was 546. that's pretty that's kind of the best score we've ever had on this game that really is the highest number but the fact that she started with me yeah that's the problem Daniel yeah your score was 9162. did I take it with smoke was that what was your big money that was worth 700. oh my goodness dude it came down uh my one oh my God Pete it was smaller than smoke but it was next he was 360. yeah I went for Pete hoping you would veto so that I could grab the smoke how do we miss Ron Swanson yeah well also and also Ron Swanson's mustaches in here no there's the art bag you might have taken it with our bag leather was a good one I said iodine not because there's a lot in there but I think a lot of people just associate eyeless Scotch with iodine it's much more of a Laphroaig note oh yeah it's pretty big oh I don't find iodine in like nearly as much as I do love froig goat ass yep we have learned a lot today my wisdom is rock hard right now perfect time for us to consider this episode's sponsor this episode is sponsored by ritual you know that the top five best-selling gut supplements by the top five Brands don't include a postbiotic with symbiotic plus you get a Prebiotic a probiotic and a postbiotic supplement to support your gut Digestive and immune Health Brianna what is a Prebiotic and why is it good for you prebiotics support the growth of good bacteria inside of your gut right you got the probiotic stuff we hear a lot about that what's the problem yeah probiotic is a good bacteria that's live cultures that go into your stomach and help with bloating gas diarrhea now when it comes to Ritual we're talking about the post-biotic this is the thing that's going to set them apart from the other options out there Brianna what is a postbiotic post-biotic provides fuel to the cells that help make up the gut lining within your stomach creating a barrier to keep all the good stuff in and the bad stuff out the symbiotic plus is a delayed release Capsule that's designed to go past the stomach and into the colon where it's going to do the most good and it's minty fresh okay did you ritual is offering you all 20 off your first order right now go to ritual.com 20 whiskey or use code w tribe20 at checkup [Music] you're drinking this neat are you drinking this on the Rocks you're drinking this in a cocktail no not surprisingly the vast majority of them bees are drinking this neat this is 84 percent uh 13 are doing it on the Rocks interesting enough only three percent in cocktails fair enough so we did the knee pour yes which is obviously what the vast majority of people are doing with 11.16. whenever we pulled the Magnificent bastards in the community Tab and the YouTube channel here how many people do you think are doing it on the Rocks what percentage oh percentage of our people yeah but I'm gonna say 85 85 86 85 so 85 85 neat neat okay 84. oh what no way I'm glad I went with it yeah so on the Rocks this is the best minority really in the cocktail 13 13 on the rocks and then we'll get to the cocktail in just a second three percent though I don't think I've had lug of Woolen on the routes I don't either if I do something on the Rocks it's smoky it's usually look for like yeah all right first time first time for everything it smells still like magnificently luggable I want to give that just a second to get a little colder it's basically a slightly cooled off meat Pour at this point one big ice bowl it's nice yeah it's the right way to do it it won't melt nearly as quickly but it also won't chill it off nearly as quickly it made it sweeter and it dropped the smoke still smells Smoky but it doesn't taste Smoky I'm gonna swirl it weird are you holding the Ice Cube still while you're doing that yeah you think that gives you more cross flow across the cube shut up this is gonna be way colder than yours yeah it loses a lot I think it took down the sweetness really yeah I'm not fighting sweetness I'm finding the the brininess the saltiness the the peat smoke but the sweetness is what got buried for me oh okay as it gets more watery yeah the sugars go down the point is if you're doing the neat pour with the lagable and 16 you're not missing much if you put it on the Rocks if you're the 13 that are putting it on the Rocks what do you like about it being on the Rocks other than just being cold maybe just they just like it cold now the three percent of the people that are doing a cocktail sure let's for shits and giggles let's try out the log of only 16 cocktail what do we got hello we are making a Rob Roy cocktail with lagavulin 16. chill your glasses to do that you put a little bit of ice with some water [Music] fill your mixing glass with ice one and a half ounces of Lagoon okay three four sounds sweet vermouth a few dashes of angostura bitters mix it up all right dump out your chills this is called this is a Rob Roy yes yes it is but with Smoky scotch you guys out of the blue selected what I order at a bar for a cocktail these days yeah at every bar so what is a rub Roy typically made with a Rob Roy is a Manhattan where you swap the Rye with Scotch okay that's it but usually like Johnny Walker or just some Scotch right nuts if you say a smoky Rob Roy then you swap it with silver Lagoon or something yeah yeah I'm just telling you right now yeah it's delicious okay so the Smoky rub Roy yeah now when you order the bar the bartner's not gonna have any idea what you're talking about oh yeah that's a nice cocktail you did well yeah this is very well selected and and executed can I say this this may be Blasphemous yeah I'm enjoying this cocktail more than the neat poor of vlogger rolling 16. well earlier because we started it early in the day so it's like a breakfast like oh okay yeah this is classy and delicious it's not too sweet is fantastic not too sugary isn't it amazing I may have a new favorite cocktail no I know that's what I'm saying the one thing and again it's a mean nitpick I'm trying to find something to fall in love with we just came fresh off the heels yeah of what the neat poor is and even the right rocks the stuff that you love about the the log of bullet it gets a little watered down yeah but the flavors that are there are beautiful yeah and it adds some complexity to that sweetness but it is simple but regardless this is that question we also asked our giant whiskey loving community on a scale of one to five stars where do you rank the log of Allen 16 when it comes to Smoky eyeless scotches this is kind of the Cornerstone of that entire experience one is it absolutely horrible two is it Matt three is this pretty good four is it great or five is it magnificent in every way I'm going to guess 4. 46 is the winning thing at four stars oh the next highest one is 32 percent at five stars people are loving themselves some logical and 16. three stars 16 two stars three percent meh one star uh two percent absolutely horrible okay so that comes in at the average score of just off the top of my head totally doing this without the assistance of foreknowledge 4.04 we're gonna round that to a four this is what I do when I'm not lying to you top comment for the flavored cloud in the community tab that's where we're getting the flavors from you guys Jonathan C he's finding Pete tobacco and a reason to feel Joy that means you're doing it correctly on the star rating top comment Santa last Christmas brought me my first Vlog of only 16 having having only tasted other eyelids of Laphroaig and Ard bag both I love luggable and is the one I enjoy the most it's like an art bag who has grown up and is now a college educated adult oh this fighting words Cult of hardbacks show up all right if you like logavolin 16 then I've got a whiskey that you need to try that was awesome and that whiskey is khalila 12. now coila is also on Iowa and it has that same kind of kind of smoky Briny note that logavolin has but it's a little softer touch and the mid palette has a little more citrus and kind of zesty notes almost to it it doesn't have quite the same Hefty earthy notes and it drinks really soft and I think that's also what makes it a really great blending whiskey coola is actually the smoke component in a lot of Blends most notably Johnny Walker cheers all right we're gonna go through and read some bad reviews of the log of Ulen 16. now this is the eyeless scotch and as we know this is a scotch that is very squarely in the love it or hated category reveal some reviews that obviously hate it that we've not seen yet so Brianna what's the first review what do we got not worth two cents it's awful I think it's atrocious tastes like I'm burned out forest fire threw it out threw it out wow I would have taken it yeah you could have made a fast friend give it to me somebody with better taste than you yeah you taste clearly sucks that is a foul on the play that is in violation of Row one of the whiskey tribe the best whiskey is the whiskey you like the drink the way you like to drink it who's talking about lagavulin oh I'll allow it forget about I'm not a specialist in Irish or Scotch whiskey but I had in years many of pleasant taste or very good yikes yep we opened it and found smoked poison liquid inside disgusting never had in my mouth garbage like this interesting yeah not my cup of tea well if you're psychotic man who loves to waste forty dollars for drinking Betadine then don't hesitate go for this one I'm sure you will be utterly satisfied cheers forty dollars for log of only 16. he puts an X at the end it's a kiss and a kiss your hug XO I hate it cheers like vodka from an ashtray some hype sorry but this is horrible fun gift from an ashtray that's not even close person whose name isn't listed you're stupid there's another flag on the play that is in violation of rule one of the whiskey sorry tastes like Garden mate I spent 70 quid on this for my mate's 30th and he let me try some it literally tastes like bum hole with sticks bum hole with sticks sticks worris whiskey this is the worst whiskey I've ever tried don't buy this it's just a waste of money 16 years you also forgot the like 10 throwing up emojis oh yeah and then he says I've tried everything this one is the worst can you relate to any of these no okay me oh sticks in the bum so in the comment section below let us know what you think we should do a collective group Community review on so it's just not a couple of reviewers giving their opinions in Mass how are people enjoying and experiencing a specific whiskey what whiskey do you think we should try next thank you",
